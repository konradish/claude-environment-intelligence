# Claude Environment Intelligence (CEI) - Action Plan

**Project Name**: Claude Environment Intelligence (CEI)
**Repository**: claude-environment-intelligence
**Status**: Implementation Ready

## Key Improvements Based on Anthropic Best Practices

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Structure Using XML Tags

**Current Issue**: Basic prompts without structured output
**Best Practice**: Use XML tags for better parsing and reliability

```markdown
# /scan-env command enhancement
Analyze the current development environment systematically.

<environment_analysis>
<system_info>
Gather OS details, architecture, and version information
</system_info>

<tool_discovery>
Identify available development tools and their versions
</tool_discovery>

<limitation_detection>
Test for known environment limitations:
- WSL2 symlink behavior with git operations
- File system permissions and mount points
- Network connectivity and proxy settings
- Container runtime availability
</limitation_detection>

<performance_baseline>
Establish baseline metrics for file I/O, network, and compute
</performance_baseline>
</environment_analysis>

Output your findings in structured format with clear sections.
```

### 2. Extended Thinking Integration

**Current Issue**: Commands don't leverage Claude's reasoning capabilities
**Enhancement**: Integrate extended thinking for complex analysis

```markdown
# /analyze-tool <tool> <workflow> - Enhanced version
Think deeply about the tool evaluation process before starting.

<thinking_instructions>
Before analyzing the tool, think through:
1. What are the potential failure modes for this tool?
2. What environment-specific variations might exist?
3. What are the most common user errors with this tool?
4. How can we verify successful operation vs. silent failures?
</thinking_instructions>

Analyze the tool workflow systematically...
```

### 3. Parallel Tool Execution Patterns

**Current Issue**: Sequential operations that could be parallelized
**Enhancement**: Leverage Claude 4's parallel execution capabilities

```markdown
# Enhanced efficiency prompt
For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

When scanning the environment, run these checks in parallel:
- System information gathering
- Tool version detection  
- Network connectivity tests
- File system permission validation
```

### 4. CLAUDE.md Memory Integration

**New Feature**: Project-specific memory files for consistent behavior

```markdown
# .claude/CLAUDE.md template for projects using CEI
# Project Environment Profile

## Known Environment Characteristics
- [Discovered through /scan-env]
- WSL2 environment with Docker Desktop
- Node.js v20+ with npm global prefix configured
- Git configured with safe.directory exceptions

## Tool Workflows Verified
- [Generated through /doc-workflow commands]
- Next.js deployment: Verified working
- Docker compose: Requires --no-cache flag
- Tailwind build: Custom config needed

## Project-Specific Limitations
- [Discovered through testing]
- Cannot use symlinked folders for git operations
- Requires elevated permissions for port 80
- Proxy required for npm registry access

## Common Commands
@commands/project-specific.md
```

### 5. Improved Output Formatting

**Current Issue**: Text-heavy outputs that are hard to scan
**Enhancement**: Structured, actionable formats

```markdown
# Enhanced /scan-env output format
<scan_results>
<summary>
Environment: WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04 + Docker Desktop
Status: ✅ Development Ready / ⚠️ Limitations Detected / ❌ Issues Found
Confidence: High/Medium/Low
</summary>

<critical_findings>
🚨 Git operations fail in symlinked directories
⚡ Fast I/O performance detected
🔧 Docker requires manual start
</critical_findings>

<environment_matrix>
| Component | Version | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 | ✅ | WSL2 |
| Node.js | v20.11.0 | ✅ | Global prefix configured |
| Docker | 24.0.7 | ⚠️ | Manual start required |
| Git | 2.39.1 | ⚠️ | Symlink limitations |
</environment_matrix>

<next_actions>

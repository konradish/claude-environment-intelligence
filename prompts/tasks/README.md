# Task Prompts

Reusable action prompts for common development and operational tasks.

## Available Tasks

*Task prompts will be added here as the collection grows*

## Task Prompt Structure

Each task prompt should include:

- **Objective**: Clear statement of what the task accomplishes
- **Prerequisites**: Required tools, permissions, or context
- **Parameters**: Configurable inputs (file paths, search terms, etc.)
- **Output Format**: Expected result structure
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes

## Usage Pattern

Task prompts are designed to be:
- **Composable**: Can be chained together in workflows
- **Parameterized**: Accept configuration without modification
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Observable**: Provide clear progress and completion signals

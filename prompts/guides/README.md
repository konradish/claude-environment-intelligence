# Workflow Guides

Higher-level agent workflows that combine multiple tasks and environmental awareness.

## Available Guides

*Workflow guides will be added here as the collection grows*

## Guide Structure

Each workflow guide should include:

- **Workflow Overview**: Multi-step process description
- **Prerequisites**: Required environment setup and tools
- **Task Sequence**: Ordered list of task prompts to execute
- **Decision Points**: Conditional logic and branching
- **Quality Gates**: Validation steps and success criteria
- **Rollback Procedures**: Recovery from partial failures

## Usage Pattern

Workflow guides are designed to be:
- **End-to-end**: Complete processes from start to finish
- **Adaptive**: Handle variations in environment and requirements
- **Resilient**: Graceful handling of intermediate failures
- **Auditable**: Clear logging of decisions and outcomes

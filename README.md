# Claude Code Command Pack

A curated set of production-tested slash commands for Claude Code that provide systematic workflows for environment discovery, tool validation, and code analysis.

## ‚ö° Slash Command Architecture

This repository is designed as a **Claude Code Command Pack** - install once, use everywhere:

‚Ä¢ **Global availability**: Commands work in any project directory
‚Ä¢ **Zero clutter**: No copying files or cluttering working directories  
‚Ä¢ **Parameterized**: Dynamic arguments via `$ARGUMENTS` keyword
‚Ä¢ **Isolated workspaces**: Generated files don't interfere with your project
‚Ä¢ **Composable**: Commands combine for complex workflows

## üöÄ Quick Install

```bash
# Create commands directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands

# Copy commands (choose one method)
cp commands/* ~/.claude/commands/

# OR clone and link for easy updates
git clone <this-repo> ~/.claude/prompt-packs/llm-env
ln -s ~/.claude/prompt-packs/llm-env/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
```

**Usage**: Start Claude Code anywhere, type `/` to see available commands.

## üìã Available Commands

### Environment Discovery
- **`/env-probe`** - Discover system capabilities and create detailed env_report.md
  - Analyzes OS, mounts, tools, network, and performance
  - Identifies WSL2/Linux specifics and limitations

### Workflow Documentation
- **`/workflow-doc <tool> <workflow>`** - Document and test tool workflows with verification
  - Example: `/workflow-doc wrangler proxy-deploy`
  - Creates isolated workspace, documents steps, provides cleanup
  - Never uses placeholders - all commands are verified

### Code Analysis  
- **`/search-code <pattern>`** - Search and analyze code patterns across codebase
  - Example: `/search-code getUserData` 
  - Finds definitions, usages, tests with context
  - Intelligent scope filtering and categorization

## üéØ Command Benefits

- **Workspace Isolation**: All generated files go into `workspace/` subdirectories
- **Clean Execution**: No file clutter in your working directory
- **Verified Steps**: Commands are tested, not theoretical
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Both workspace and service cleanup instructions
- **Multi-experiment Friendly**: Run multiple workflows without interference

## üîÑ Legacy Prompts

The `prompts/` directory contains the original prompt templates that were converted to slash commands. These remain for:
- **Reference**: Understanding the design principles
- **Customization**: Creating your own command variations
- **Documentation**: Explaining the layered architecture approach

**Recommendation**: Use the `commands/` directory for day-to-day work.
